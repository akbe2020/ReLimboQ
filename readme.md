## What is this?
The server is full, and players are waiting, but it doesnâ€™t have to be frustrating. With the ReLimboQ plugin, powered by [LimboAPI](https://github.com/Elytrium/LimboAPI), players can wait seamlessly without ever feeling disconnected.

This plugin does one thing and does it well: it queues players efficiently. When your server reaches its capacity, players are placed in a queue and temporarily moved to a lightweight, minimal environment.
